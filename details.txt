Hello my friend, I want you to add a system for accepting or rejecting publishers (sending an email either accepting or rejecting ),
in addition to requesting information from those in the registration, such as the country, phone number, and source of traffic,
asking where she met us from, and adding a field to put the preferred platform to communicate with her, such as Telegram.


As for offers, I will specify the devices on which the offers should appear, the countries, the offer title,
the offer description, and the amount I will pay for each successful conversion.
This means that when a publisher creates a content lock and gets a link,
then promotes it and then the traffic comes in,
that lock displays country-appropriate offers. From which visitors and devices come,
and for every successful conversion,
the publisher gets the commission set for that completed offer
